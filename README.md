# Formal Logic Deduction
![framework_overview](./images/framework_overview.PNG)

**F**ormal **L**ogic **D**eduction (**FLD**) is a project to teach language models deductive reasoning using synthetically generated examples based on formal logic theory.
FLD project originates from the paper [Learning Deductive Reasoning from Synthetic Corpus based on Formal Logic](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/morishita23a.html).

## What's good?
FLD serves as ...

* ðŸŽ“ **A foundation for learning logical reasoning**. FLD corpus teaches *fundamentals* of logic, as it adopts a well-grounded set of deduction rules based on formal logic theory.
* ðŸ‘Š **A challenging benchmark** of logical reasoning, as a fully fine-tuned T5 language model cannot solve *even half* of the problems from the most difficult variant of FLD corpora.
* ðŸš€ **A basis for future experimental studies**, as it includes several toolkits as follows:
    - the corpora easily used via [ðŸ¤— the huggingface hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hitachi-nlp/FLD.v2).
    - [a simple training script](https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/FLD-prover/), which is a minimal adaptation of huggingface's script.
    - [a flexible corpus generator](https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/FLD-generator/), with which one can generate one's own corpus with a desired setting.

See [our paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/morishita23a.html) for details.
