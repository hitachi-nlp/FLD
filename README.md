# Formal Logic Deduction
![deduction example](./images/deduction_example_GPT4.png)

**F**ormal **L**ogic **D**eduction (**FLD**) is a project to teach language models deductive reasoning using synthetically generated examples based on formal logic theory.
FLD project originates from the paper [Learning Deductive Reasoning from Synthetic Corpus based on Formal Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07336).

## What's good?
FLD serves as ...

* ðŸ‘Š **A challenging benchmark** of logical reasoning, as it assesses pure logical reasoning *isolated from knowledge*. Indeed, even GPT-4 can solve only half of the problems.
* ðŸŽ“ **A foundation for learning logical reasoning**. FLD corpus teaches *fundamentals* of logic, as it adopts a well-grounded set of deduction rules based on formal logic theory.
* ðŸš€ **A basis for future experimental studies**, as it includes several toolkits alisted below.

## Contents
* You can [use FLD corpora](https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/FLD-corpus) via [ðŸ¤— huggingface hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hitachi-nlp/FLD.v2).
* You can [evaluate various LLMs](https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/FLD-fewshot-ICL-eval), such as GPT-4 and Llama, in few-shot in-context learning settings.
* You can fine-tune language models on FLD corpora. You can either use a logical-reasoning framework [LogiTorch/logitorch](https://github.com/LogiTorch/logitorch), or [our Transformers-based script](https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/FLD-prover/).
* You can generate corpora with your own setting using [a corpus generator](https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/FLD-generator/).
